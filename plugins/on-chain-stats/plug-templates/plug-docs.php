<p>This plugin currently (as of v0.91.00) supports Bitcoin and Solana on-chain stats charts / maps in the user interface, under the plugin menu. In the future (coming soon&trade;), there will be webhook support as well.</p>

<p>Bitcoin does NOT support revealing node TYPE, beyond P2P-related capabilities, so that's the only node-type-related filter we have in the interface (see <a href='https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/33930#issuecomment-3568645276' target='_BLANK'>Peter Wuille's comment on GitHub</a>).</p>
