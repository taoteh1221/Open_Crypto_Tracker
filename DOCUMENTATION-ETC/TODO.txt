GENERAL NOTES SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Always set bluefish to "4 spaces" as a tab indentation, and enabling indentation of selected text. INDENTING SPACING IN FILES #CHANGES AUTOMATICALLY# WHEN "BLUEFISH => PREFERENCES => INITIAL DOCUMENT SETTINGS => TAB WIDTH" IS CHANGED, SO BE CAREFUL WHEN FIXING!!


Try sticking with small infrastructure changes, and breaking up large changes into small milestones, then plenty of time is spent on UX / testing / logging / debugging.


Always test in a WebKit-based browser [Epiphany|Safari|Midori], Firefox, and Chromium.


Post on hive, telegram, discord, Twitter, Facebook (and r/CryptoMarkets and r/CryptoCurrency on MAJOR RELEASES) whenever there is a new release of the app.


ALWAYS do everything in the optimizations / bugs / tests / ux / qa / other section of this list FIRST, before adding ANY new features (find every flaming turd before we start a dumpster fire).


Youtube channels on the resources page, that MAY BE DYING (keep an eye on them): (none right now)


Don't require any higher than PHP v7.2 until 2023 or later, as Ubuntu 18 only packages PHP 7.2.x by default as of right now. We don't want to hold back some users capability to run the app easily.


Use new internal api function calls as much as possible for the tests logic we had already built.


Keep github price chart bootstrap download updated weekly!


ALWAYS bundle desktop and server downloads with releases from now on (NOT just source code archives). The secondary Desktop Edition github repo is just for backups and staging. Keep it simple.


Prioritize building the mobile templates / language translation modules / admin interface / native app "desktop editions" (via PHPdesktop) above all other infrastructure. Then it's the most useful for the maximum number of people as it can be going forward.


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
OPTIMIZATIONS / BUGS / TESTS / UX / QA / OTHER SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Remove defipluse API support, the service is a joke. We have coingecko support now anyway.


Add config setting to set which asset price light chart shows by default.


Add a "reset light charts" button to the admin "reset" page. Also maybe in the future look into "auto-detecting" light chart updating better when restoring from older archival data (overwriting archival data and having light charts detect that change).


$ct_conf will EVENTUALLY be populated ENTIRELY by the JSON config read logic we currently have in app-lib/php/other/security/secure-cache-files.php. RIGHT NOW alot of init.php is DEPENDING ON $ct_conf values WAAAY BEFORE WE RUN secure-cache-files.php (from what will eventually just be the DEFAULT config within config.php). This is ok for now, BUT after the admin interface has been fully populated WE'LL NEED LOGIC LIKE secure-cache-files.php RUN BEFORE #ANY# $ct_conf LOGIC IS USED. To significantly reduce the required amount of refactoring, we may be able to run logic similar to app-lib/php/other/sub-init/minimized-sub-init.php VERY EARLY WITHIN INIT.PHP? We do check for a corrupt JSON config in minimized-sub-init.php, so this may be reliable to call early? In this case, some (if not all) the logic in secure-cache-files.php AND minimized-sub-init.php should be consolidated into one file for effiency / clarity AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.


Some crypto tracker EMAILS were not going through when sending DIRECTLY to gmail, BUT ALEXA / TEXT / TELEGRAM ALERTS WORKED FINE. When set to go to another email on the same server it goes through fine. Double-check gmail filters, MAYBE I BLACK-HOLE SOME EMAILS WITH MY SETTINGS?


When importing a CSV spreadsheet in linux desktop edition with cookies enabled, UNLESS we manually save the portflio data on the update page AFTER importing, the portfolio data is lost when we close the app. See if this also affects windows desktop edition, and server edition.


"CSV import suceeded" has a 'dismiss' link that doesn't work...when clicked, it reloads a blank portfolio page. But when the normal 'refresh' link is used INSTEAD atop the portfolio page, the imported data stays just fine. Funny thing is the "CSV import suceeded" message ALSO PERSISTS THIS WAY. Figure out whats going on there. Also check the "Your CSV import upload failed." logic. Start tests with Windows Desktop Edition.


Look into merging all our classes in the portfolio app like so: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2374828/how-to-merge-two-class-in-php  Then it is more programmer-friendly, as all functions can then be called from something like $ct->my_object() for simplicity sake.


For 'Desktop Edition' (using phpdesktop), look into using docker images for cross-platform compatibility (Windows / Mac / Linux).


AFTER the admin config GUI has been built out, make sure plugin configs are re-loaded AFTER 'activate_plugins' in the power user section has been updated.


Update Portfolio page screenshots, since we added the 'Rank' column AND REBRANDED app name.


Since we already wait for the page to load for initiating batch-grabbing news feeds(?), maybe we can store the user-selected feeds in local storage, since the data set is potentially VERY large (to save alot on cookie header data)? Look over the batch loading logic, and see if we can do it more with JavaScript instead of PHP (except for the batch calls endpoint on the server). Same should generally go for price charts (as we load after the page has loaded), so look into that too.


Consider adding some SPECIFIC filenames that are sensitive data to obfusc_path_data() via the $file = basename($path) method. Not sure if needed for log security, BUT right now obfusc_path_data() DOES #NOT# OBFUSCATE THE FILENAME AT ALL (just path up to the file).


Make all coin configs (assets and price alerts / charts) CASE-INSENSITIVE. Most efficient way to do this would be by auto-correcting in other/app-config-managment.php, to be the correct case even if a user editing config.php used the wrong case.


Check in on defipulse API data, unit tests showed it failing across the board for price data. 


Add bonifida / serum markets support.


Remember when restoring charts from archive, if you delete instead of overwrite, the file permissions may be incorrect when restoring (as its not default permissions same as the app sets).


Add 'cancel' button on privacy mode PIN modal, and adjust the background color / border color / border width to 'pop out' better in the light / dark themes.


Consolidate CSV import / post data importing that are near the top of the update and portfolio page UI rendering files, into just one subroutine BEFORE the UI is rendered...like we ALREADY DID for cookie data in those sections.


Make sure everything STILL runs smoothly with the charts page turned off.


Add same logic we have for internal API request throttling to the admin login / reset attempts, make setting configurable.


Add remote IP address data to ALL relevant security error logging everywhere in the app.


Write debugging tests for rss feeds.


Overhaul / optimize config checks.


Consider moving the error log alerts for "email not configured" under the new "notify" category (which avoids duplicate messages).


Add power failure corruption checks (like chart price data has), to system charts and price alerts file cache data.


Check optimization by enabling "telemetry" debug mode, and reviewing debugging logs.


Check log formatting for every debug mode.


Consolidate num_to_str() calls, to speed up runtime.


See if exchange API data arrays can be manipulated slightly to build a reusable module for every exchange's API calls.


market_ to mrkt_
markets_ to mrkts_
leverage_ to lvrg_


Research whether POST data size affects header size like cookie data size does.


Table column sorting is a tad borked up if you disable privacy mode AFTER a page reload. See if this can be 'reset' or whatever for better UX.


Breakup numerous function call parameters for calls like ui_asset_row() into a param array, like we did for update_all_cookies(). Also do line breaks like we do for arrays on any large string inputs into function calls, like we did for log().


Add ENJ / MATIC kraken markets.


Look into adding Balancer (BAL), Bittrex just added it for US customers.


Make sure ALL MARKETS are added FOR ALL SUPPORTED EXCHANGES (EVERY EXCHANGE IN exchange-ticker-apis.php), then re-run the exchange summaries printout (in debug mode), for updating documentation on the web page / README / in config.php.


Cross-browser test RTL (right to left) effects from middle eastern currency symbols being injected into the interface output for those currencies


Test unicode mobile text message with no space in front of hex-encoded data (forgot to try that, coded and ready to go now...see $ct_gen->charset_encode() and /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/Developing-maintaining/DEBUGGING.txt).


Review Help FAQ, and config.php settings documentation.


Think over what other "faq" entries would be helpful.


Create github wiki with the current documentation for the portfolio app.


May come in handy for writing PHP unit tests: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/861254/iterate-over-properties-of-a-php-class


Investigate / report to PHP devs (IF IT'S NOT A FILE READ ISSUE) the .htaccess password bug (/classes/core/cache.php, line 189) issue on Windows 10 / XAMPP 3.3.0 / PHP 7.4.24: $htaccess_password = crypt( $htaccess_password, base64_encode($htaccess_password) );


Look into laptop touchscreen zingchart js error on Ubuntu 20.04 / Chrome, when hiding / showing assets in performance chart (but is fine on Ubuntu 20.04 / Chrome on desktop). IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MY CODE, SO REPORT IT TO THE ZINGCHART TEAM.

FEATURES / STRUCTURING SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


For mobile templates, we are completely ditching the desktop layout, for a design similar to mobile app portfolio tracking layouts. Hopefully we can still do sorting by marketcap, held amount, most volume, etc, AND add in sorting by gain / loss (which may also be useful in the desktop layout).


For the language translation cache (to avoid asking API for a translation if we already did once), include a hash digest of the original English text used to translate. That way if the hash changes for the current English text used (English is never translated as it's the default), we know we need to re-translate with a fresh API call, and also save the new hash digest of the current English text as well.


Add a dedicated system chart file for plugin cron stats ONLY (runtime seconds, etc).


Add ability to choose what decimal and thousands seperators to use.


Look into adding temp monitoring upport for systems other than raspi devices: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-cpu-temp


A good demo app for building out the interface hooks for plugins to support the GUI runtime (not just the cron runtime), would be a monthly interest cost calculator on debt (credit cards / loans / etc).


For admin area pages / sections, consider doing subsections in a modal subwindow, with iframes for loading through 'wizard' steps or opening different categories. It would possibly keep a native app 'feel' while also reducing admin page load times. Think it over, figure out the best solution here for a great UX.


On admin "assets" page, add a button atop the page called " Add New Asset Or Market". Then, on page 1 of the 'add asset' wizard (multi-step on separate modal pages), only have the radio selection choices (only one can be selected): 'Add new asset' and 'Add new market to existing asset'. 


The upcoming 'add new asset market' admin interface feature should be a "wizard" with a few "steps", to have a decent user experience AND break the logic up into different checks / steps under the hood as well. 1) Asset name and symbol, 2) Choose from a list of exchanges and pairs available for that asset, 3) Enable charts and or alerts for different exchanges and pairs.


On 'more stats' page, add a 'market volume' chart, showing a multi-line chart (like asset comparison chart) of all [charts-fiat-conversion-currency] volumes for an asset's configured markets THAT HAVE CHARTS ENABLED (so we grab values from lite chart data). Default to showing Bitcoin, allow using different lite chart time periods (like asset comparison chart).


Add logic to offer securing the computer in the auto-install. Add subsections "Requiring Password For Sudo (Admin)" / "Disabling Bluetooth" / "Enabling firewall" inside a main prompt "Would you like to secure your computer against hacks?" For the bluetooth disabling section, include a commented section so we know if we've already APPENDED (>> IN BASH, NOT >) to boot/config.txt (like we do for htaccess). For firewall setup add a loop that you add new ports to open and quit the loop when finished...AND AUTOMATICALLY OPEN PORTS 80 / 443 FOR THIS APP, AND SSH STUFF TOO IF DETECTED AS INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM!


Create a power user config option to toggle between plain text and HTML email. We can have the $ct_cache->queue_notify() function detect if HTML email is enabled, and run email messages through PHP's built-in nl2br() function if so, which converts newlines to <br /> tags.


Add a "Reset lite charts" button on the admin 'Reset' page, to trigger rebuilding lite charts.


Fully include all leverage in all portfolio summaries, with "(X% leverage)" next to each summary.


Store the php timeout as a cached var, and compare the CACHED app config to it at runtime. If they differ from each other, delete the root htaccess and user.ini files to trigger recreating them with an updated php timeout. Also make sure the php timeout setting and updating logic / functions are using the CACHED app config.


Store visitor access data in A SEPERATE flat file / json format PER IP ADDRESS (so mulitiple values can be read back into the app before updating, then updated values saved back in json overwriting previously saved values, BUT AVOIDS MULTIPLE IP ADDRESES OVERWRITING SAME DATA). Last X unique ip addresses (as a power user config setting), showing ip address's last user agent / last visit time (AND HISTORY OF DIFFERENT USER AGENTS / LAST VISITS) / total visits count. Drop any over X ip addresses off the list based on oldest LAST VISIT timestamps. Store visitor data (user agent, etc) in a SECURED CACHE filename based off MD5 HASH of ip address. INITIAL BUILDOUT SHOULD ONLY BE FOR 'ui' RUNTIME DATA ONLY.


Create mobile devices templates, have the portfolio data rows show each piece of data on its own line the entire width of the screen (like android asset trackers do). We may need to create header / footer for mobile as well.


Add additional ability to do telegram webhooks, to query asset prices at different exchanges through telegram chat with the chat bot. Example: "/price ETH/USDT @ Binance"


Documentation for Webhook features.


Add webhook keys on admin page.


Do a gains / losses bar chart for the gains / losses summary (tooltip, like balance stats chart).


On 'more stats' page, have a 'market comparison stats' chart for arbitrage on one asset (picked from dropdown menu), with default showing BTC / All pair's markets, with USD conversion. Make it a bar chart, based off the marketcap chart template. Have 3 drop-down menus: Asset, Pair (with an All option), Primary Currency (conversion). Looping through asset pairs / markets should be a straight forward algo that does the job.


Add market stats summaries from chart data, like bar charts for exchange volume on certain assets / pairs (on 'view more stats' page).


Auto-update feature like WordPress has (downloads a zip file upgrade from github, and exctracts it overwriting the old app files).


Option to use new zip file encryption password feature to encrypt portfolio spreadsheet exports when downloading exported portfolio data (with password entered in the UI, #NOT# $ct_conf['gen']['backup_arch_pass']).


For each cat_key => cat_val loop app config, to automate categorizing new admin settings tabs...selects for arrays, text fields for strings. Maybe certain key names get checkbox / radio button fields.


On admin config tabs, add logic to have onchange update a tracking value FOR THAT TAB ONLY, so if a user changes a setting and DOESN'T SAVE IT AND CLICKS ANOTHER SECTION / TAB / LINK they get an alert to confirm leaving the tab without saving their changes. Include on exiting admin config area (returning to portfolio page / closing tab).


Once an admin interface is fully built out, permanently switch out the app config upgrade logic for our new logic (already built, just enable in secured cache logic).


Add force reset logic for app config, if cached app version number is non-existent or below a certain version, so we force a complete reset for non-backwards-compatible upgrades.


On admin config reset tab, have "reset app config to default settings" button (with js confirm alert when pushed) that refreshes ALL the cached ct_conf from config.php settings.


Admin import / export of settings (consider security implications CAREFULLY...include an optional / mandatory checkbox to encrypt to zip file with our new zip encryption feature).


When cached app config is independent of config.php updating-wise, use the show / hide link to have an optional email field on the admin registration page, and mention it enables password resetting via email.


Add admin settings feature to restore chart data from the zip archive backups (with admin authentication ONLY). Chart restore by prepending, so any existing data remains, BUT only if timestamp is newer than newest backups timestamp. Trigger restore from newest backups folder backup by placing a blank file named RESTORE_CHARTS in the queue directory.


Give plugins a dedicated admin page (if any are activated), for UI settings etc.


Create help page modal for explanations on all config.php settings, that we can link to / open specific sections from a click next to that setting in the admin GUI. Then we can run this through the upcoming lang_translate() function as well.


Wrap all interface English within a "placeholder" lang_translate() function call. Then from a developer perspective you can still fully see the interface logic, and build out translation logic over time later. 


Add Google or Microsoft translate API as options to translate the portfolio interface and price alerts.


Simple trading bot, to run as a cron plugin (with web UI for configuration / stats / etc)

MAYBE SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Look into X day moving average overlay for price charts.


Change the api key format to GET instead of POST on my portfolio app's internal REST API, so browser-based javascript implementations can work cross-site retrieving data.


Add an OPTIONAL 'cron_plugins_runtime' stat in system charts (save as NO_DATA if non-existant to avoid UI rendering, like we do for temperature sensor). We'd need to append to the same line in the .dat file RIGHT AFTER THE CORE LOGIC HAS ALREADY WRITTEN TO IT. Not sure if this potentially could cause corruption issues in edge cases?


Add defipulse 'preferred platform' config in power user section, which falls back to ANY highest volume / liquidity platform's market if no market is found for the preferred platform.


Add drop-down menu feature next to "Save Updated Portfolio" buttons for "save as": cookie data | only post data.


Create "Export your feeds" link on News page, to XML / JSON format file download (like exporting portfolio logic).


In debug mode, maybe add our new 'used ram' stat instead (that doesn't include buffers / cached ram).


Use SQLite for any data storage that needs query capability (can also be used in PHPDesktop version, as it supports SQLite).


Make default btc exchange in config.php optional, and auto-configure if invalid or left blank, based off the default primary currency setting (still log errors though). Additionally, consider defaulting to USD if the primary currency setting is invalid / blank as well (as long as we also error log any detected issues there too)??


SQL-based accounts for storing configuration settings per-user (including setting up new assets available at supported exchanges), BUT !NEVER! STORES PORTFOLIO DATA (FOR PRIVACY / SECURITY-SAKE).


When sql host config has been set in config.php, BUT DATABASE SETUP HAS NOT RUN YET, have the UI require entering the sql user password to initiate database setup (for security)


Maintain sql-based config as completely separate module(s) from the file-based config (config.php), except for the sql host connection / authentication details (put those at the top of the config.php configurations).


Convert all long hand javascript to jquery?


Save trading notes via the new ajax.php logic (rather than reload the entire app)?


Add memory limit to all runtimes?


Maybe add feature to auto-detect new / removed markets?


Alerts if NOT admin ip address visiting (admin ip stored in config setting)?
