4.14.4:

-Bug fix for too many selected news feeds crashing the app server (feeds are now loaded individually in the background, like charts are)

-Bug fix for light charts (correctly pruning light charts with low time spans / data points less than allowed maximum)

SYSTEM STATS CHARTS AFTER UPGRADE TO v4.09.0 OR HIGHER WILL STILL RETAIN OLD SYSTEM STATS DATA FOR MEMORY USAGE, BUT WILL BE LABELED DIFFERENTLY ("USED MEMORY" INSTEAD OF "FREE MEMORY"). JUST IGNORE THE OLDER MEMORY DATA, OR RESET YOUR SYSTEM STATS CHARTS BY DELETING: /cache/charts/system/

-DAILY limit advanced API throttling (for APIs like AlphaVantage FREE tier), for more reliable market data requests

-Stock Overview information, when hovering over the info icon on the My Portfolio page (next to the asset name)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.02

-BUG FIX: LINUX Desktop Edition "FIX-LINUX-DESKTOP.bash" script refactored / fixed, to workaround Fedora 42 using a beta compiler (which causes fatal PHP build errors)

-BUG FIX: Upgraded crypto-js to v4.2.0, to fix random number weakness vulnerability

-BUG FIX: Fixed price chart titles covering time period links, on smaller screens

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-Better Desktop Edition user experience, related to the built-in (EMULATED) Cron Job / Scheduled Task Manager (only shows the running notice when it's time for a FULL run, NOT just a CHECK)

-Upgraded to Jupiter Aggregator TOKEN API v2 (UPGRADE THIS APP BY AUGUST 1ST 2025, TO KEEP GETTING JUPITER MARKET DATA)

-Upgraded to Jupiter Aggregator PRICE API v3 (UPGRADE THIS APP BY AUGUST 1ST 2025, TO KEEP GETTING JUPITER MARKET DATA)

-Minor polished interface styling / UX

-Code refactoring / cleanup

-------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.03

-BUG FIX: Fixed FALSE POSITIVE alerts in the malware scanner built-in to this app, for asset market IDs CONTAINING CRYPTO ADDRESSES, when adding new assets / markets in the admin interface (for Jupiter Aggregator, CoinGecko Terminal, etc), which caused 'Invalid security token' error messages when reviewing desired market additions

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-Scheduled maintenance routine, that deletes any prices charts left over, after DELETING AN ASSET from the Admin Area: "Asset Tracking => Portfolio Assets"

-Minor user experience improvements / runtime optimizations

-------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.04

-BUG FIX: MAJOR fixes / refactoring / optimizations to the BTC value conversion function (used to convert / determine values between Currencies and other Cryptos, everywhere in this app)

-BUG FIX: Fixed CoinGecko marketcap data being mapped to the wrong coin (with the SAME TICKER...now 'app id' is used, instead of ticker)

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-Secured / optimized the Access Stats feature (in Admin Area => System Monitoring), to run from /cache/secured/, and run faster

-Added "Referrer" data for Access Stats (shows what page the visit initiated from, if available)

-Accurate coingecko currency support (currency list is now retrieved from their API)

-Secured 'address-balance-tracker' plugin's cache data, to run from /cache/secured/

-Added BUNDLED Access Stats (PER IP ADDRESS stats are also still available)

-Significant user experience improvements / runtime optimizations

-------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.05

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-User experience improvements / runtime optimizations

-Optimized / refactored API throttling system

-------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.06

-BUG FIX: Fixed error "No...data received...file /cache/secured/a*********s/ip_XX*********X.dat (aborting...)", originating in prune_access_stats() (called during scheduled maintenance), which occurred when no stats remained AFTER PRUNING any outdated access stats (the stats file is properly deleted now). You can safely ignore past error logging that looks like this. Sorry!

-BUG FIX: Fixed edge-cases where updating the CACHED application configuration could FAIL (any updates now initiate a 2 second pause AFTER, so any file locks release on slower machines, in case an additional update needs to happen during the same runtime)

-BUG FIX: Fixed throttled APIs (like AlphaVantage FREE tier) not allowing LIGHT CHART REBUILDS (which caused related price charts to not appear in the user interface, AFTER resetting light charts) Sorry!

-BUG FIX: Fixes for time period (light) price charts reliability, where they would have GAPS between data points, greater then the time intervals set for that particular time period chart

-BUG FIX: Fixes for price charts importing reliability, where they would not properly REBUILD the time period (light) charts

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-We now SKIP including light charts in chart backup ZIP files, so the backup will be significantly smaller for large chart collections (we automatically rebuild light charts from archival charts if they don't exist, so we don't require backing them up)

-Overhauled upgrade system, that now supports importing config backups (safely)

-More reliable plugin validity checks

-Minor user experience improvements

-------------------------------------------------------------------



-------------------------------------------------------------------
6.01.07

-BUG FIX: Fixed issue on "My Portfolio" page, where average-paid-per-unit of asset was hard-coded to an 8 decimal maximum (causing low value tokens to NOT display gain / loss data)

-BUG FIX: Miscellaneous (minor)

-Loosened username restrictions for the "Admin Area => Security => Interface Login" setting (so only validity check is a 4 character MINIMUM)

-Added to the "on-chain-stats" plugin: Solana Node Count / Solana Version charts (Solans Node Geolocation map coming soon™)

-Increased amount of currency / crypto maximum decimals allowed (in the "Asset Tracking => Currency Support" Admin Config)

-Better AlphaVantage "Stock Overview" API integration / UX

-Buildout of developer-only-maintenance plugin
