INSTALLATION AND SETUP...


IMPORTANT NOTES: YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO CREATE AN ADMIN LOGIN (FOR SECURITY OF THE ADMIN AREA), #WHEN YOU FIRST RUN THIS APP#. IT'S #HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DO THIS IMMEDIATELY#, ESPECIALLY ON PUBLIC FACING / KNOWN SERVERS, #OR SOMEBODY ELSE MAY BEAT YOU TO IT#.


Recommended MINIMUM system specs:

1 Gigahertz CPU / 512 Megabytes RAM / HIGH QUALITY 16 Gigabyte MicroSD card (running Nginx or Apache headless with PHP v7.2+)


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting Up The 'Desktop Edition' (runs very easily, like any other normally-downloaded native app)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To install as a normal native app on your laptop / desktop, download the "Desktop Edition" of the app here:

https://github.com/taoteh1221/Open_Crypto_Tracker/releases


After downloading, unzip the contents of the download to your desktop or other preferred file location (it doesn't matter, put it wherever you want to). Now use your operating system's file browser to enter the app's main directory, and click on "RUN_CRYPTO_TRACKER" to launch the app. TO USE PRICE CHARTS AND PRICE ALERTS TO EMAIL / TEXT / ALEXA / TELEGRAM, YOU #MUST# LEAVE THE APP RUNNING UNLESS YOU MANUALLY SETUP A CRON JOB! (see: "Setting Up Price Charts And Email / Text / Telegram / Alexa Price Alerts")


IMPORTANT NOTES FOR WINDOWS USERS: 

YOU NEED "7 ZIP" INSTALLED, TO OPEN AND EXTRACT THE DOWNLOAD ARCHIVE:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-download-and-install-7-zip-on-windows


IMPORTANT NOTES FOR LINUX USERS: 

IF YOU GET THE ERROR: "CGI program sent malformed or too big", YOU LIKELY NEED TO BUILD A PHP BINARY THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR UNIQUE SYSTEM SETUP. Try running the script "FIX-LINUX-DESKTOP.bash" (compatible with Debian / Fedora) in the Desktop Edition main folder, which should fix things automatically for you. Just make sure it's file permissions are set to "executable" (chmod +x, OR chmod 755 should do that). IMPORTANT STEP: YOU *MUST* SHUT DOWN THE DESKTOP EDITION OF THIS APP *BEFOREHAND*, OTHERWISE THIS SCRIPT *CANNOT* INSTALL THE CREATED PHP BINARY IT BUILDS!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Automatic Install / Upgrade For 'Server Edition' On Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian, On Home / Internal Network (recommended way to PRIVATELY / CHEAPLY use this app)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To install / upgrade everything automatically on Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian, copy => paste => run the command below in a terminal program (using the 'Terminal' app in the system menu, or over remote SSH), while logged in AS THE USER THAT WILL RUN THE APP (user must have sudo privileges):

wget --no-cache -O FOLIO-INSTALL.bash https://tinyurl.com/install-crypto-tracker;chmod +x FOLIO-INSTALL.bash;sudo ./FOLIO-INSTALL.bash


Follow the prompts. This automated script gives you the options to: install / uninstall a PHP app server automatically, download / install / configure / uninstall the latest version of the Open Crypto Tracker app automatically, setup a cron job automatically (for price alerts / price charts), and setup SSH (to update / install web site files remotely to the app server via SFTP) automatically. 


When the auto-install is completed, it will display addresses / logins to access the app (write these down / save them for future use).


SEE /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/RASPBERRY-PI/ for additional information on securing and setting up Raspberry Pi OS (disabling bluetooth, firewall setup, remote login, hostname, etc).


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installing On A Web Server / Manual Installation ('Server Edition'):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Just upload / move this app's files to your PHP-based app server directory (with an FTP client like FileZilla) and you should be all set, unless your host is a strict setup related to file writing permissions, in which case the 'cache' directory permissions should be set to '770' chmod on unix / linux systems (or 'readable / writable' on windows systems). 


Your web host must have CURL modules activated on your HTTP server. Most web hosting companies provide this "out-of-the-box" already. This app will detect whether or not CURL is setup on your website server (and also alert you to any other missing required system components / configurations). 


WINDOWS 10 / 11 USERS WHO ARE USING XAMPP WILL NEED TO ENABLE GD FOR PHP (FOR THE ADMIN LOGIN CAPTCHA SECURITY) BEFORE USING THIS APP. PLEASE SEE THE SCREENSHOT LOCATED AT /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/XAMPP-ENABLE-GD.png FOR A VISUAL ON SETTING THIS UP EASILY.


See "Setting Up Price Charts And Email / Text / Telegram / Alexa Price Alerts", for how to setup a cron job / scheduled task for additional features.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upgrading / Downgrading Existing Installations ('ALL Editions'):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


You can upgrade / downgrade ANY (Desktop or Server) Edition, by overwriting / replacing the app files and folders with the version you prefer to run. Just download the SERVER EDITION for the version you want (EVEN IF YOU ARE RUNNING A DESKTOP EDITION), and use these files / folders within the download archive to replace the files / folders in your EXISTING INSTALLATION.


If you are running the DESKTOP EDITION, the app files / folders are located in the subdirectory named "INSTALL_CRYPTO_TRACKER_HERE". If you are running the SERVER EDITION, AND you installed it with auto-installation script, JUST RUN THE AUTO-INSTALLER AGAIN to automatically upgrade TO THE LATEST VERSION. 


IF you are running in HIGH SECURITY MODE, make sure you backup your app / plugin configs (the auto-installer will automatically do this for you), BEFORE DOING THE UPGRADE / DOWNGRADE. AFTER UPGRADING / DOWNGRADING, MANUALLY RE-ADD each of your custom settings, TO ASSURE PROPER CONFIG FORMATTING FOR THE NEW VERSION YOU ARE NOW RUNNING. IF you are NOT running in high security mode, you do NOT need to worry about ANY of this (as these files are merely DEFAULTS in normal / medium security modes [if you ever want to RESET the app, on the Admin "Reset / Backup & Restore" page]).


For additional safety, IF you are running in NORMAL / MEDIUM SECURITY MODE, don't forget to BACKUP YOUR CUSTOMIZED SETTINGS before performing any upgrading / downgrading, on the Admin "Reset / Backup & Restore" page. This is ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU ARE DOWNGRADING, as it requires a TOTAL RESET of the app / plugin (to assure it still runs properly). Even some UPGRADES may need to reset some INDIVIDUAL settings, although this is rare, AND affects only the setting(s) that need advanced upgrades (NOT the entire app / plugin configuration). IF app / plugin UPGRADING did NOT preserve any of your pre-existing customized settings, open your backup config IN A TEXT EDITOR, and find what you need to re-add (by using the Admin interface). IN THE FUTURE (coming soon™), you should eventually be able to SAFELY "Restore" your backup config, on the Admin "Reset / Backup & Restore" page. For now though, it's UNSAFE to BLINDLY use and OLD config backup FROM A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE APP.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setting Up Price Charts And Email / Text / Telegram / Alexa Price Alerts (get notifications sent to you, even when your PC / Laptop is offline)...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


IMPORTANT NOTES: THIS IS FOR 'SERVER EDITION' ONLY, UNLESS YOU DISABLE 'desktop_cron_interval' (AND reload / restart app) IN THE POWER USER CONFIG IN THE 'DESKTOP EDITION'...IN WHICH CASE READ THE CRON JOB INSTALL SECTIONS BELOW THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM.


You can setup price charts or price alerts in your app install. Price alerts can be sent to email, mobile phone text, Telegram, and Alexa notifications. You will be alerted when the [configured default primary currency] price of an asset goes up or down a certain percent or more (whatever percent you choose in the settings), for specific exchange / base pair combinations for that asset. You can even setup alerts and charts for multiple exchanges / base pairs for the same asset.

	    
Running price charts or price alerts requires setting up a cron job or scheduled task on the Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian / Windows 10 machine or website server (this is automated for Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian users using the automated FOLIO-INSTALL.bash script / Windows 10 users who run the ADD-WIN10-SCHEDULER-JOB.bat file), otherwise charts / alerts will not work. Also see the related settings in Admin Config for charts / alerts. 


Once a cron job or scheduled task is setup ON YOUR APP SERVER, there is no need to keep your PC / Laptop turned on (UNLESS you are running the app server on the same device). The price charts and price alerts run automatically from your Open Crypto Tracker app server installation. If you encounter errors or the charts / alerts don't work during setup, check the app logs file at /cache/logs/app_log.log for errors in your configuration setup. Basic checks are performed and errors are reported there, and on the Settings page. 


If you decide to turn on cron job / scheduled task based features, then the file cron.php (located in the primary directory of this app) must be setup as a cron job or scheduled task on your Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian / Windows 10 / website server device. 


As mentioned previously, if you run the automated setup / install script for Debian / Ubuntu / DietPi OS / RaspberryPi OS / Armbian / Windows 10 devices on home / internal networks, automatic cron job / scheduled task setup is offered as an option during this process. If you are using a full stack website host for hosting a TLD website domain name remotely, consult your app server host's documentation or help desk for their particular method of setting up a cron job. 


Note that you should have the cron job run every 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes 24/7, based on how often you want chart data points / alerts / any other cron based features to run. Setting up the cron job to run every 20 minutes is the RECOMMENDED lowest time interval. IF SET BELOW 20 MINUTES, light (time period) chart disk writes may be excessive for lower end hardware (Raspberry PI MicroSD cards etc). IF SET #VERY LOW# (5 / 10 minutes), the free exchange APIs may throttle / block your data requests temporarily on occasion for requesting data too frequently (negatively affecting your alerts / charts). 


FOR WINDOWS 10 / 11 USERS, just click and run the file 'ADD-WIN10-SCHEDULER-JOB.bat' found in the main directory of the app, follow the prompts, and everything will be automatically setup for you (if PHP-CLI isn't auto-detected, it allows you to manually enter the path to it). As long as you login into THE SAME Windows account after system startup, the scheduled task will run until your computer is shut off OR you logout of that user account (SO YOU *NO LONGER* NEED TO LEAVE THE *DESKTOP EDITION* APP RUNNING ANYMORE FOR SCHEDULED TASKS [if you use that edition]). ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU ARE RUNNING THE *DESKTOP EDITION*, YOU'LL *ALSO* NEED TO SET 'desktop_cron_interval' TO ZERO (IN THE ADMIN CONFIG "POWER USER" SECTION), AND RESTART / RELOAD THE DESKTOP APP.


FOR LINUX / MAC USERS, here is an example cron job command line for reference below (NOT including any cron parameters your host interface may require), to setup as the "command" within a cron job. Replace system paths in the example with the correct ones for your server (TIP - A very common path to PHP on a server is /usr/bin/php):

/path/to/php -q /home/username/path/to/website/this_app/cron.php


FOR LINUX (if you have systemd), here is another example of a COMPLETE cron command that can be added by creating the following file (you'll need sudo/root permissions): /etc/cron.d/cryptocoin on a linux-based machine with systemd (to run every 20 minutes 24/7)...play it safe and add a newline after it as well if you install examples like these (must be owned by "root" / chmod permission set to 644):

*/20 * * * * WEBSITE_USERNAME_GOES_HERE /usr/bin/php -q /var/www/html/cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1


FOR LINUX / MAC, if your system DOES NOT have the directory /etc/cron.d/ on it, then NEARLY the same format (minus the username) can be installed via the legacy 'crontab -e' command (YOU MUST BE logged in as the user you want running the cron job):

*/20 * * * * /usr/bin/php -q /var/www/html/cron.php > /dev/null 2>&1


IMPORTANT CRON JOB NOTES: 

MAKE SURE YOU ONLY USE EITHER /etc/cron.d/, or 'crontab -e', NOT BOTH...ANY OLD DUPLICATE CRONTAB ENTRIES WILL RUN YOUR CRON JOB TOO OFTEN. If everything is setup properly, and the cron job still does NOT run, your particular server MAY require the cron.php file permissions to be set as 'executable' ('750' chmod on unix / linux systems) to allow running it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the built-in (internal) REST API:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This app has a built-in (internal) REST API available, so other external apps can connect to it and receive market data, including market conversion (converting the market values to their equivalent value in country fiat currencies and secondary cryptocurrency market pairs).


To see a list of the supported assets in the API, use the endpoint:

/api/asset_list


To see a list of the supported exchanges in the API, use the endpoint:

/api/exchange_list


To see a list of the supported markets for a particular exchange in the API, use the endpoint:

/api/market_list/[exchange name]


To see a list of the supported conversion currencies (market values converted to these currency values) in the API, use the endpoint:

/api/conversion_list


To get raw market values AND also get a market conversion to a supported conversion currency (see ALL requested market values also converted to values in this currency) in the API, use the endpoint:

/api/market_conversion/[conversion currency]/[exchange1-asset1-pair1],[exchange2-asset2-pair2],[exchange3-asset3-pair3]


To skip conversions and just receive raw market values in the API, you can use the endpoint:

/api/market_conversion/market_only/[exchange1-asset1-pair1],[exchange2-asset2-pair2],[exchange3-asset3-pair3]


For security, the API requires a key / token to access it. This key must be named "api_key", and must be sent with the "POST" data method.


IMPORTANT REST API NOTES: 

The 'Linux Desktop Edition' of this app has a slightly different endpoint format for the internal REST API (due to unavoidable feature restrictions). Login to your Admin Config area, and see the 'Internal API / Webhook' section, for the endpoint and example code required to use the internal REST API.


SEE /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/REST-API-EXAMPLES.txt FOR EXAMPLES OF CALLING THE API WITH CURL, JAVASCRIPT, AND PHP


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding / editing / deleting assets and markets in the portfolio assets:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


IMPORTANT NOTE: DOING THIS MANUALLY IN A TEXT EDITOR IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR ***HIGH SECURITY ADMIN MODE***. AS OF v6.00.39 AND HIGHER, YOU CAN NOW DO IT VIA AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, IN THE "Asset Tracking => Portfolio Assets" ADMIN INTERFACE.


Below is an example for editing your assets / markets in the file config.php (located in the primary directory of this app), within the PORTFOLIO ASSETS section. It's very quick / easy to do (after you get the hang of it, lol). Also see the text file /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/CONFIG-EXAMPLE.txt, for a pre-configured set of default settings and example assets / markets. 


Contact any supported exchange's help desk if you are unaware of the correct formatting of the trading pair naming you are adding in the configuration file (examples: Kraken has arbitrary Xs inserted in SOME older pair names, HitBTC sometimes has tether pairs without the "T" in the symbol name, and bybit can prepend "1000" to low-unit-value coin's market IDs).


Support for over 40 trading pairs (country fiat currency or secondary crypto, contact me to request more): 

AED / ARS / AUD / BDT / BRL / BTC / CAD / CHF / CLP / CZK / DKK / ETH / EUR / GBP / GEL / HKD / HUF / IDR / INR / JPY / JUP / KRW / KWD / LKR / MXN / MYR / NGN / NIS / NOK / NZD / PHP / PKR / PLN / RMB / RUB / SAR / SEK / SGD / SOL / THB / TRY / TWD / UAH / USD / USDC / USDT / VND / ZAR
